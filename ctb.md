# Capture the Bitcoin Challenge (CTB)

TABConf 2023 will mark the 3rd year of the CTB challenege. The CTB is a scavenger-hunt that is held during the conference. 
This scavenger hunt will test your knowledge of Bitcoin & challenge you to think outside the box.

What is the goal?
- Have fun playing the game
- Learn something new
- Make new friends
- Be the first person to snatch the bitcoin from a specific UTXO

Where is the first clue?
- The first clue will be on the back-face of the copper challenge coin you receive when you attend TABConf 2022. 
- Optionally, you can start with the silver challenge coin which is available for purchase on the registration page. 
- The silver coin does not not give you any advantage in playing the game, but you will look like a badass for having a 1 ounce 0.999 fine silver coin.

What do I need in order to participate?
All that you need to participate is to attend TABConf and pick-up your challenge coin on your way in!
