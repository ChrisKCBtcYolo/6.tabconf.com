TABConf is The Atlanta Bitcoin Conference â€” an event for building communities, providing education, and supporting developers. We like to think of this as the most inclusive, organic, grassroots event possible for Bitcoin.

What can I expect at TABConf?

Builders Day: a friendly place to learn how to contribute to open-source projects in bitcoin. This is a great one to attend if you hope to work in the bitcoin industry as a developer!

Workshops: Attend great developer-focused bitcoin workshops.

Villages: Speakers, panel discussions, open hackerspace, Capture the Bitcoin, and more.

Afterpartys!

See [last year's website](https://2022.tabconf.com/)for a good sense of what TABConf programming is like.
