# TABConf
An event for building communities, providing education, and supporting developers. We like to think of this as the most inclusive, organic, grassroots event possible for Bitcoin.

## What can I expect at TABConf?

**Builders Day:** a friendly place to learn how to contribute to open-source projects in bitcoin. This is a great one to attend if you hope to work in the bitcoin industry as a developer!

**Workshops:** Attend great developer-focused bitcoin workshops.

**Villages:** Speakers, panel discussions, open hackerspace, Capture the Bitcoin, and more.

**Afterparties!**

See [last year's website](https://2022.tabconf.com/) for a sense of what TABConf programming is like.
