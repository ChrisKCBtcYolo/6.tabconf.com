# TABConf is The Atlanta Bitcoin Conference 
An event for building communities, providing education, and supporting developers. We like to think of this as the most inclusive, organic, grassroots event possible for Bitcoin.

What can I expect at TABConf?

Builders Day: a friendly place to learn how to contribute to open-source projects in bitcoin. This is a great one to attend if you hope to work in the bitcoin industry as a developer!

Workshops: Attend great developer-focused bitcoin workshops.

Villages: Speakers, panel discussions, open hackerspace, Capture the Bitcoin, and more.

Afterpartys!

See [last year's website](https://2022.tabconf.com/)for a good sense of what TABConf programming is like.
